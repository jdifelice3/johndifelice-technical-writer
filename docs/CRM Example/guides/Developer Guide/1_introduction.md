## What is ZohoDataExplorer?
ZohoDataExplorer is a custom front-end for the Zoho Recruit.

Zoho Recruit is a cloud-based applicant tracking system (ATS) and CRM system designed to help staffing agencies, corporate HR teams, and recruiters manage the entire hiring process. Itâ€™s part of the broader Zoho ecosystem of business applications.

Zoho Recruit can be used to manage client and contact data. Unfortunately, the app is not performant, has poorly documented features, is difficult to use--even for experienced users--and custom features developed by Zoho are cost-prohibitive.

For these reasons, ZohoDataExplorer was created.
