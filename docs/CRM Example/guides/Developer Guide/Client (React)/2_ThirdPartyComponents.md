## React Toastify

Toast notifications, or toast messages, are unobtrusive, in-app pop-up messages that provide users with feedback about an operation. Toasts usually disappear after a given time; therefore, removing them doesnâ€™t require any user action. However, you can also close a toast notification before the expiration of the timeout.
