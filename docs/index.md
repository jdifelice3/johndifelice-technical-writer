# Welcome

Hi, I’m John DiFelice, an **enterprise architect** and **published/produced author** pivoting into technical writing.

I’ve spent 20+ years designing and documenting complex systems (cloud, integration, security, data) and just as long honing the craft of clear, engaging prose through fiction and playwriting. The result is deep technical credibility plus a strong narrative sense. This is what I bring to documentation.

## What I Bring to Your Team

- **Translating complexity into clarity**  
  Architectural decisions, integration patterns, and operational procedures explained for *both* engineers and stakeholders.

- **Domain Knowledge**  
  ◦ Wealth Management and Banking:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 years of experience delivering software products for investment firms, banks, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and REITs.  
  ◦ Health Insurance:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 years of experience documenting processes and methodologies for health insurance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies.  
  ◦ Telecommunications:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 years of experience developing, architecting, documenting, and leading knowledge<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer sessions for two large telecommunications companies.  
  ◦ Bitcoin/Crypto:

- **Docs-as-Code Experience**  
  Markdown, Git, PR reviews, and CI-driven publishing (MkDocs). Treating docs as a first-class part of the build.

- **The right tools**  
  API references (OpenAPI/Swagger), quick starts, diagrams (Visio/Mermaid).

- **Reader-first writing**  
  I apply writing techniques to guide users, set context, reduce cognitive load, and anticipate questions.
